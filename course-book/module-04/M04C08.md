## M04C08: Resource-Aware Streaming – Ensuring Generators Close and Clean Up Correctly

## Progression Note
By the end of Module 4, you will master safe recursion over unpredictable tree-shaped data, monoidal folds as the universal recursion pattern, Result/Option for streaming error handling, validation aggregators, retries, and structured error reporting — all while preserving laziness, equational reasoning, and constant call-stack usage.

Here's a snippet from the progression map:

| Module | Focus                                    | Key Outcomes                                                                 |
|--------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3      | Lazy Iteration & Generators              | Memory-efficient streaming, itertools mastery, short-circuiting, observability |
| 4      | Safe Recursion & Error Handling in Streams | Stack-safe tree recursion, folds, Result/Option, streaming validation/retries/reports |
| 5      | Advanced Type-Driven Design              | ADTs, exhaustive pattern matching, total functions, refined types             |

> **Core question:**  
> How do you guarantee that every resource-holding generator (files, network connections, GPU contexts) is properly closed on normal completion, consumer exceptions, producer exceptions, or early termination from breakers — all while keeping the pipeline pure, lazy, and composable?

We now take the `Iterator[Result[Chunk, ErrInfo | BreakInfo[ErrInfo]]]` stream from M04C07 and face the final real-world reliability question:

**“My embedding stream opens a single persistent HTTP connection (or GPU context) for the whole run. When a breaker fires after 10 000 chunks, the connection is never closed — I leak sockets and GPU memory.”**

The naïve solution is manual try/finally around the whole pipeline:

```python
conn = open_connection()
try:
    for chunk in chunks:
        yield embed_via_connection(conn, chunk)
finally:
    conn.close()
```

This works once — but it forgets to close on early break, consumer exceptions, or when you later parallelise.

The production solution uses tiny, composable resource managers that guarantee cleanup on every possible exit path — including when Core 7 breakers fire early.

**Audience:** Engineers who open any long-lived resource inside a generator and refuse to leak sockets/memory on errors or aborts.

**Outcome:**  
1. You will wrap any resource-holding generator with automatic cleanup that works on all exit paths.  
2. You will compose nested resources safely and prove closure via Hypothesis.  
3. You will ship a RAG pipeline that never leaks resources — even when breakers abort early.

We formalise exactly what we want from correct, production-ready resource management: cleanup on all paths, scoped effects, laziness (no premature iteration), and compatibility with breakers.

## Concrete Motivating Example

Same 100 000 chunk tree from previous cores, but now embedding uses a single persistent connection:

```python
def embed_via_connection_stream(chunks_with_path):
    conn = http_pool.acquire()          # long-lived connection
    try:
        for chunk, path in chunks_with_path:
            yield safe_remote_embed(conn, chunk, path)
    finally:
        http_pool.release(conn)         # must run even on early break!
```

If a breaker fires after 10 000 chunks, the `finally` block is not guaranteed to run promptly in a multi-stage pipeline → the connection can remain open until the generator is explicitly closed or garbage-collected.

Desired behaviour:

```python
with managed_stream(lambda: embed_via_connection_stream(chunks_with_path)) as safe_stream:
    for r in circuit_breaker_rate_emit(safe_stream, max_rate=0.2):
        if isinstance(r, Err) and isinstance(r.error, BreakInfo):
            report_circuit_break(r.error)
            break
        process(r)
# → Connection always released, even on early break
```

## 1. Laws & Invariants (machine-checked)

| Law                          | Formal Statement                                                                                            | Enforcement |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Cleanup on All Paths**     | Resource is closed on normal exhaustion, consumer exception, producer exception, and early breaker termination. | `test_cleanup_normal`, `test_cleanup_consumer_exc`, `test_cleanup_producer_exc`, `test_cleanup_on_break`. |
| **Scoped Effects**           | No side effects outside managed enter/exit; wrapper is pure except for the managed resource.               | Reproducibility + no global mutation. |
| **Laziness**                 | Entering manager does not advance the iterator; resource creation semantics match direct use.             | `test_manager_lazy_entry`. |
| **Composition (LIFO)**       | Nested managers close in reverse order (LIFO) on any exit path.                                            | `test_nested_manager_lifo`. |
| **Equivalence**              | Wrapped stream yields identical values to unwrapped (except cleanup).                                      | `test_managed_equivalence`. |

These laws guarantee zero resource leaks in real pipelines.

## 2. Decision Table – Which Resource Wrapper Do You Actually Use?

| Resource Type                  | Needs Factory? | Nested? | Recommended Wrapper |
|--------------------------------|----------------|---------|---------------------|
| Simple generator with .close() | No             | No      | `with_resource_stream` |
| Generator from factory         | Yes            | No      | `managed_stream` |
| Multiple resources             | Yes            | Yes     | `nested_managed` |
| Arbitrary closable object      | –              | –       | `auto_close` |

**Always** wrap resource-holding generators.  
**Never** use bare try/finally in pipeline code — use these wrappers.

## 3. Public API Surface (end-of-Module-04 refactor note)

Refactor note: resource wrappers live in `funcpipe_rag.policies.resources` (`src/funcpipe_rag/policies/resources.py`) and are re-exported from `funcpipe_rag.api.core`.

```python
from funcpipe_rag.api.core import auto_close, managed_stream, nested_managed, with_resource_stream

```

                self._stack.close()

    return _Nested(managers)
```

### 4.4 auto_close – Universal Closable Wrapper

    """Close obj if it has .close(); respect existing context protocol; otherwise no-op."""
    if hasattr(obj, "__enter__") and hasattr(obj, "__exit__"):
        return contextlib.nullcontext(obj)  # keep outer protocol in control
    if hasattr(obj, "close"):
        return contextlib.closing(obj)

with managed_stream(lambda: embed_via_connection_stream(chunks_with_path)) as safe_stream:
    for r in circuit_breaker_rate_emit(safe_stream, max_rate=0.2):
        if isinstance(r, Err) and isinstance(r.error, BreakInfo):
            report_circuit_break(r.error)
            break
        process(r)
# → Connection always released, even on early break
```

## 8. Pre-Core Quiz

1. with_resource_stream for…? → **Auto-close existing generator**  
2. managed_stream for…? → **Factory-created resource streams**  
3. nested_managed for…? → **Compose multiple context managers**  
4. auto_close for…? → **Any object with .close()**  
5. Cleanup guaranteed on…? → **All exit paths including breakers**

## 9. Post-Core Exercise

1. Wrap a file-reading generator with `with_resource_stream` → test cleanup on partial iteration.  
2. Use `managed_stream` for temporary files → test on early breaker.  
3. Compose three nested resources → verify LIFO closure order.  
4. Add `auto_close` to your embedder → verify no leaks on OOM.

**Next:** M04C09 – Functional Retries with Policies (Pure, Composable Retry Loops).

You now have the complete toolkit to never leak a resource again — even when everything goes wrong. The rest of Module 4 is about retries and final reporting.
